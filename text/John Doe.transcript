XXX Hello. This is the researcher speaking, whenever a series of three XXX is prefixed. I am now talking to the participant, number PARTICIPANT. Hello PARTICIPANT.

YYY COUGH Hello, my INAUDIBLE [name is] PARTICIPANT. How are you today?

XXX Not bad thanks! LAUGH

YYY CHUCKLE

XXX So I wanted to disc-

YYY -I'm very happy to be here! COUGH Oh, sorry, did I interrupt you?

XXX SIGH It's okay.

YYY NERVOUS CHUCKLE Oops!

CONTEXT there is delay in the communication, hence PARTICIPANT interrupting me
