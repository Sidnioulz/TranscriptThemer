## Transcript Themer

A basic set of scripts to transform raw text transcripts into easily readable HTML files. These scripts require the use of a special syntax (see `text/John Doe.transcript`), and parse it in order to provide an HTML file that:

 * distinguishes participant (`XXX` prefix) and interviewee (`YYY` prefix) statements
 * assigns a number to each statement for easier referencing / searching
 * themes the "INAUDIBLE" keyword to help you distinguish where your recording is broken
 * looks nice, basically

By not having to worry about the structure of your document, you can focus on transcribing faster. You can also create snippets in your text editor to inject the `XXX` and `YYY` prefixes after every exchange, thereby speeding the transcription process a bit more.
